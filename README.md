# Medical Chatbot with GAN, Mistral LLM, FAISS, and Streamlit

A medical chatbot designed to provide accurate and context-aware responses to healthcare-related queries. This project integrates Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), the Mistral Large Language Model (LLM), and FAISS for efficient vector storage and retrieval, all wrapped in a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

## Features
- **Accurate Responses** : Powered by the Mistral LLM for domain-specific medical knowledge.
- **Efficient Search** : Utilizes FAISS for fast similarity searches and retrieval of high-dimensional embeddings.
- **GAN-Based Enhancement** : Improves generative capabilities for better response quality.
- **Interactive UI** : Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and responsive user experience.
- **LangChain Integration** : Enables seamless chaining of prompts and memory management.
- **Hugging Face Models** : Leverages pre-trained models for natural language understanding and generation.
